Features:-

1. Simulates social media engagement data (likes, shares, comments, post types).

2. Analyzes average engagement metrics for different post types (carousel, reels, static images, etc.).

3. Provides AI-generated insights using GPT integration with Langflow.


Tools and Technologies:-

1. DataStax Astra DB: For storing and querying social media data.

2. Langflow: For workflow creation and GPT integration.

3. HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend development tools.

4. GitHub: Version control and repository hosting.


Project Workflow:-

Data Generation:

A mock dataset simulating social media engagement was created and stored in DataStax Astra DB.

Analysis:

Langflow workflow constructed to calculate average engagement metrics for post types.

Insights:

1. GPT integration in Langflow used to generate insights, e.g.:

2. Carousel posts show 20% higher engagement than static posts.

3. Reels drive 2x more comments compared to other formats.


Installation and Setup:-

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Pushendra2020/The-hackthon-repo.git

Import the provided Langflow workflow JSON.


Launch the project:
1. to run frontend, navigate to Public dir by using cmd cd Public and then use cmd npm run dev.
   
2. to run backend, run node server.js.


Usage:-

1. Run the Langflow workflow.

2. Use the provided frontend interface to input post types (carousel, reels, etc.).

3. View generated insights on the interface or in the console.
